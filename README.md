### **Dom in Javascript**
`DOM` is a JavaScript concept. DOM stands for `Document Object Model.`
It represents the HTML structure, where each element can be `manipulated (read, write, delete, and add)` using JavaScript. This is done with the help of the DOM concept.

`Window` in JavaScript is a `browser object.` It contains many things related to the browser environment.
Inside the `window object`, there is a `document object`.

The `document object is a part of the window object`.The `document object` gives access to the HTML content and allows JavaScript to `control and manipulate the web page`.
